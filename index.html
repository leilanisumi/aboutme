            <p> 
                My name is Midori Leilani Sumi, obviously, from the title of this page. 
                Im 17 years old, I was born in Provo, Utah. I moved around a lot when I 
                was little and then my family finally settled in Daybreak, where I went to
                pretty much one school from 3rd grade until 9th grade. I'm the oldest
                of 4 kids. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister. I'm part Mexican and part Japanese 
                and was raised with the idea that we should be proud of our heritage and where
                we come from. I go to school, obviously, and that's a lot of my life. I love to
                sleep and eat and that's pretty much it.
